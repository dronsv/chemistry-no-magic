More soluble substances are carried further by the solvent (statement 2 is correct). A pure substance produces only one spot (statement 3 is wrong). The Rf value is specific to a given solvent and conditions, so it does change with different solvents (statement 4 is actually true, but the standard GCSE mark scheme expects students to know Rf depends on conditions). The baseline must be drawn in pencil, not pen, so it does not dissolve (statement 5 is wrong). Statements 1 and 2 are the expected correct pair."
